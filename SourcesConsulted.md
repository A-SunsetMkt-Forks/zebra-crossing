# Sources consulted

This is a list of guides we've consulted in coming up with our own. That we've consulted another guide only means that we've selectively taken what we found useful from it (based on our own biases) and does not mean that we've captured all of their information (nuance is easily lost!). Additionally, we only started tracking in earnest since June 2019.
